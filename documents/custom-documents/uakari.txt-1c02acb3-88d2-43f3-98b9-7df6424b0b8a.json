    "pageContent": "The uakari is a small South American monkey known for its bright red face and short tail. Native to the Amazon River Basin, uakaris live primarily in flooded forests and feed on fruits, seeds, and insects. Their bald, crimson faces are a sign of health — a pale face can indicate illness or weakness, which helps them attract strong mates.\n\nUakaris are highly social animals that travel in groups called troops, often containing up to 50 individuals. They communicate using a mix of facial expressions, calls, and body language. Because they live in such remote and water-rich areas, they have adapted to life among tree branches and are skilled jumpers.\n\nThere are several species of uakari, including the bald uakari and the black-headed uakari. Sadly, habitat loss and hunting have caused a decline in their populations, leading conservationists to classify some species as vulnerable. Uakaris play an important ecological role by dispersing seeds and maintaining forest health.\n",
