    "pageContent": "Overview\n--------\nLlamas are domesticated South American camelids, closely related to alpacas, guanacos, and vicuñas. They’ve been bred for thousands of years, primarily by the indigenous peoples of the Andes mountains, especially in Peru and Bolivia.\n\nPhysical Characteristics\n------------------------\n- Size: Adult llamas stand about 1.7–1.8 meters (5.5–6 feet) tall at the head and weigh between 130–200 kilograms (290–440 pounds).\n- Coat: Their wool is soft, lanolin-free, and can come in a wide range of colors—white, brown, black, gray, or spotted.\n- Ears: Llamas have long, banana-shaped ears, which help distinguish them from alpacas.\n\nBehavior and Temperament\n------------------------\n- Llamas are social herd animals and prefer to live with others of their kind.\n- They are gentle and curious, though they can be stubborn or spit when annoyed or threatened (mostly at each other).\n- Llamas communicate through body language and humming sounds.\n\nDiet and Habitat\n----------------\n- Llamas are herbivores, feeding mostly on grasses, hay, and other vegetation.\n- They’re adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, dry regions.\n- Their efficient digestive systems help them survive on sparse mountain vegetation.\n\nUses by Humans\n---------------\n- Pack animals: Llamas can carry loads up to 25–30% of their body weight for long distances.\n- Fiber: Their wool is used to make clothing, blankets, and ropes.\n- Guard animals: Llamas are sometimes used to protect sheep and other livestock from predators.\n\nReproduction\n-------------\n- Female llamas (hembras) have a gestation period of about 11.5 months and usually give birth to a single baby, called a cria.\n- Llamas are induced ovulators, meaning mating triggers ovulation.\n\nFun Facts\n---------\n- Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.\n- They have three-compartment stomachs for digesting tough plant material.\n- Unlike camels, llamas do not have humps.",
