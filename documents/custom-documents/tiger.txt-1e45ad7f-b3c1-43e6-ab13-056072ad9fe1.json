    "pageContent": "Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and one of the most iconic predators on Earth. They belong to the species Panthera tigris and are known for their striking orange coats patterned with black stripes, which provide excellent camouflage in tall grasses and forests. Each tiger has a unique stripe pattern, much like human fingerprints.\n\nTigers are solitary animals, typically occupying vast territories that they mark with scent and scratches on trees. They are powerful swimmers and often cool off in rivers and ponds, unlike most other big cats. Their diet mainly consists of deer, wild boar, and sometimes smaller prey, though a single tiger can take down animals much larger than itself.\n\nThere are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal, Siberian, Sumatran, Indochinese, South China, and Malayan tigers. Sadly, all are under threat due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are ongoing worldwide to protect remaining tiger populations, focusing on preserving forests and curbing illegal wildlife trade.\n\nIn many cultures, tigers symbolize strength, courage, and independence, making them both feared and revered throughout history.\n",
