    "pageContent": "Snakes are elongated, legless reptiles that belong to the suborder Serpentes. They are found on every continent except Antarctica. Snakes use their forked tongues to detect scent particles in the air, helping them track prey. Most species are non-venomous, while venomous ones use toxins to immobilize or digest their prey. Snakes regularly shed their skin through a process called ecdysis. Well-known species include pythons, cobras, and rattlesnakes.\n",
